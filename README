Greetings! Welcome to the (Alpha) Google Cloud Dataflow Java SDK.

Dataflow provides a simple, powerful model for building both batch and
streaming parallel data processing Pipelines.

To use the Google Cloud Dataflow SDK, you build a Pipeline which manages a
graph of PTransforms and PCollections that the PTransforms consume and produce.

You then use a PipelineRunner to specify where and how the pipeline should
execute. Currently there are two runners:
  1. The DirectPipelineRunner runs the pipeline on your local machine.
  2. The [Blocking]DataflowPipelineRunner runs the pipeline on the Dataflow
     Service using the Google Cloud Platform. The Dataflow Service is
     currently in the Alpha phase of development and access is limited to
     whitelisted users.
